- Make sure you can access dev environment in your Azure with proper rights -> access portal.azure.com, login, check subscriptions
- Install Azure CLI on your machine using this [guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) and make sure you can authenticate (use "az group create -n yournametest-rg -l northeurope" to check you can create resource group and then use "az group delete -n yournametest-rg" to delete it)
- Clone this repo to your computer and learn [Git basics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/gitworkflow?view=azure-devops) like clone, pull, push, commit and work with Pull requests
