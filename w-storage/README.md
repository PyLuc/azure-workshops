# Introduction to storage in Azure

Make sure you finish [preparation steps](./docs/00-PreparationAndTooling.md) before starting this workshop.

# Lab 1 - Azure Disks for your Virtual Machines and containers
In this lab we will focus on remote raw block storage devices for your compute resources - Azure Disks.

[guide](./docs/01-AzureDisks.md)

# Lab 2 - Network Attached Storage options with Azure Files and Azure NetApp Files
In this lab we will focuse on remote file systems as a service, namely Azure Files (not that for very low-latency high-performance scenarios you can also leverage Azure NetApp Files).

[guide](./docs/02-AzureFiles.md)

# Lab 3 - Object storage for applications, archiving and Big Data
In this lab we will play with object storage - modern and cheap way to store unstructured data. We will focus on basic usage, different performance tiers, data protection capabilities and integration with advanced search. No that this technology plays important role in Big Data systems with hierarchical namespace capability for Data Lake scenarios (beyond scope of this lab).
